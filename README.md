# My First Coding Project

This was my first coding project.  
I didn’t use Git back then — I kept version history manually by numbering the files.

My first project in this field — originally a school assignment, but I ended up putting a lot more into it than required. Uploading it here just for nostalgia and to keep all my stuff in one place.
